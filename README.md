Brave without the bullshit.

## Summary

This project originally aimed to patch brave to make it less annoying. However, I have recently learned that important features such as ad-blocking [require configuration and signing keys](https://community.brave.com/t/does-brave-allow-the-distribution-of-self-compiled-or-distro-compiled-binaries/457833/7) that only the official build farms have setup.

Now, this project aims to research if [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust) can be integrated within [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org) or [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

## Building

See [building.md](./docs/building.md).
